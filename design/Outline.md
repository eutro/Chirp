# Coding Research Project - Design Outline

## What we want to cover:

- Type systems
  - Type inference


- Memory Management (Automatic mm not manual)
  - Garbage Collection
    - Algorithms, implementations


- Programming Paradigms


- Runtime
  - Compiled 
  - Garbage Collector

## Implementation

- C++
- LLVM


## Steps
- First start with basics like integer,float, mul/div, add/sub ?
- Lexer (Should take a couple of hundred lines)
- Parser (Should take a couple of hundred lines)
  -Decide on grammar rules etc
