# Coding Research Project - Design Outline

## What we want to cover:

- Type systems
  - Type inference


- Memory Management (Automatic mm not manual)
  - Garbage Collection
    - Algorithms, implementations


- Programming Paradigms
   - Imperative or functional


- Runtime
  - Compiled 
  - Garbage Collector

- Syntax
- Static or dynamic typing
- Performance or readability
- What is it going to be used for?
- Build a standard library
## Implementation

- C++
- LLVM


## Steps
- First start with basics like integer,float, mul/div, add/sub ?
- For compiler:
 - Lexer (Should take a couple of hundred lines)
 - Parser (Should take a couple of hundred lines)
   -Decide on grammar rules etc
 - Abstract syntax tree
 - Machine code
