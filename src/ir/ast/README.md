# `ir/ast/`

This module represents the abstract syntax tree, or AST. This is
generated by the parser from the token stream.

This IR faithfully holds all the information of the original source
code. As such, the original source code can be completely recovered in
this form, which may be helpful for auto formatters and such.

By the compiler, this form is immediately lowered to the
[`hir`](../hir/) in a single pass.
